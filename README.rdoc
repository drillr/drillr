*Drillr* is a site for testing your coding skills. Choose drill groups within an
array of languages, and earn points and achievements for your work. See how you
stack up with other users on the leaderboard.

Drillr was made by a team of six over a weekend during CodeCore's web development bootcamp.
It's built in Rails and makes use of Bootstrap, Font Awesome and jQuery on the frontend.
